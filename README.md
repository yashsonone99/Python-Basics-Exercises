# Python-Basics
"Collection of beginner-level Python exercises covering loops, conditionals, user input, functions, and string operations including prime check, palindrome, word count, and more."

# Python Basics 
This repository contains a collection of fundamental Python exercises designed to strengthen programming logic and problem-solving skills.  
Each program demonstrates the use of "loops, conditionals, string manipulation, and functions".

🧩 Exercises Included

1. Prime Numbers  
   - Checks if a given number is prime.  
   - Uses control structures and modulus operations.

2. Product of Random Numbers
   - Generates two random numbers.  
   - Asks the user to input their product and verifies correctness.

3. Squares of Even/Odd Numbers
   - Prints squares of even or odd numbers between 100–200.  
   - Showcases use of loops and range filtering.

4. Word Counter
   - Counts word frequency in a given text using dictionaries.

5. Palindrome Checker 
   - Determines if a given string is a palindrome (ignoring case and spaces).

🧰 Tools Used
- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab.
