# Python Basics Exercises

This repository contains a collection of fundamental Python exercises designed to strengthen programming logic and problem-solving skills.  
Each program demonstrates the use of **loops, conditionals, string manipulation, and functions**.

## 🧩 Exercises Included

1. **Prime Numbers**  
   - Checks if a given number is prime.  
   - Uses control structures and modulus operations.

2. **Product of Random Numbers**  
   - Generates two random numbers.  
   - Asks the user to input their product and verifies correctness.

3. **Squares of Even/Odd Numbers**  
   - Prints squares of even or odd numbers between 100–200.  
   - Showcases use of loops and range filtering.

4. **Word Counter**  
   - Counts word frequency in a given text using dictionaries.

5. **Palindrome Checker**  
   - Determines if a given string is a palindrome (ignoring case and spaces).

## 🧰 Tools Used
